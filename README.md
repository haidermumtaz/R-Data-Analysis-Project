# R-Data-Analysis-Project

The Dataset was exceeding my GitHub Large File Storage Limit so it is not included in the repo, here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/discussion?sort=hotness

No google slide deck for this one as project is presented through Shiny Dashboard

The purpose of this project was to analyze Earth's climate change with R and visualize the key findings through a Shiny App.

To run:

shiny::runApp()

FUTURE WORK:

For future work, I would implement a time series analysis to better predict the future temperature readings as opposed to the linear model I used.

Another analysis can be done on the more specific datasets regarding tempereature by country or city, in order to visualize which places on Earth are contributing to its overall Global Warming more than others in an effort to help mitigate it.
