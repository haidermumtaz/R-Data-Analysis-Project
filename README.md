# R-Data-Analysis-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze Earth's climate change using R and visualize key findings through a Shiny App. The dashboard provides insights into historical temperature trends, future projections based on Linear Regression models, and outlines the potential impacts of global warming at various temperature thresholds.

## Future Work

1. **Advanced Time Series Analysis:**
   - Consider log transformation for temperature data to stabilize variance and improve model fit.
   - Implement more sophisticated models such as ETS, ARIMA, and Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) for improved forecasting accuracy.
